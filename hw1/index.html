            <p id="aboutText">Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, notably using significant whitespace. It provides
                constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales[citation needed]. Van Rossum led the language community until stepping down as leader in July 2018.[26][27] Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management.
                It supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional and procedural, and has a large and comprehensive standard library.[28] Python interpreters are available for many operating systems. CPython, the reference
                implementation of Python, is open source software[29] and has a community-based development model, as do nearly all of Python's other implementations. Python and CPython are managed by the non-profit Python Software Foundation.
                <br/> Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of its features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming (including by metaprogramming[42]
                and metaobjects (magic methods)).[43] Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract[44][45] and logic programming.[46] Python uses dynamic typing, and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting
                garbage collector for memory management. It also features dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution. Python's design offers some support for functional programming in the Lisp tradition.
                It has filter(), map(), and reduce() functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, and sets; and generator expressions.[47] The standard library has two modules (itertools and functools) that implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and
                Standard ML.
                <br/> While offering choice in coding methodology, the Python philosophy rejects exuberant syntax (such as that of Perl) in favor of a simpler, less-cluttered grammar. As Alex Martelli put it: "To describe something as 'clever' is not considered
                a compliment in the Python culture."[50] Python's philosophy rejects the Perl "there is more than one way to do it" approach to language design in favor of "there should be one and preferably only one obvious way to do it".[49] Python's developers
                strive to avoid premature optimization, and reject patches to non-critical parts of the CPython reference implementation that would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of clarity.[51] When speed is important, a Python programmer can
                move time-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C, or use PyPy, a just-in-time compiler. Cython is also available, which translates a Python script into C and makes direct C-level API calls into the Python interpreter.
                An important goal of Python's developers is keeping it fun to use. This is reflected in the language's name—a tribute to the British comedy group Monty Python[52]—and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials, such
                as examples that refer to spam and eggs (from a famous Monty Python sketch) instead of the standard foo and bar.[53][54] A common neologism in the Python community is pythonic, which can have a wide range of meanings related to program style.
                To say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses Python idioms well, that it is natural or shows fluency in the language, that it conforms with Python's minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. In contrast, code that is difficult
                to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic. Users and admirers of Python, especially those considered knowledgeable or experienced, are often referred to as Pythonists, Pythonistas,
                and Pythoneers.<br/></p>
